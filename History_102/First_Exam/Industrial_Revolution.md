        - 1712: first steam engine (Newcomen): coal powered
        - 1886: first true automobile (Karl Benz): petroleum
        - Scientists in the 19th century began observing and documenting the effects of emissions
    * Increased consumption and the invention of plasic & other chemical industries, create waste and pollution
    * Consequences of population growth
        - Causing pollution, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, etc.

## Negatives

# Continued
    * Growing middle class (bourgeoisie) embrace liberalism and free market capitalism,
      private interest, limited franchise (voting rights)
    * In contrast, radical reformers believe the "social question" is urgent
        - They advocated for "socialism" (common good)
    * Socialists believed liberty cannot exist without political and economic equality

## Types of Economic Systems

# Capitalism
    * Adam Smith
    * Individuals
    * Market Economy
    * Mixed Economy
# Socialism
    * Professed aims
    * Government - owns & controls key industries. Private ownership of smaller bus. may be
      permitted
    * Command Economy
    * Visible Socialism
# Communism
    * Karl Marx
    * Government controls everything
    * Command Economy
    * Communism

## Revolutionary Socialism: An Alternative to Capitalism
    * Karl Marx & Fredrich Engles published hte Communist Manifesto (1848)
    * 3 stages of history characterised by classs conflict:
        - Master v slave in antiquity
        - Lord v serf in medieval feudalism
        - Bourgeoisie v. Proletariat in modern times
    * Material forces (economic) propel this dynamic
# Karl Says
    * Growing proletariat will become aware of its exploitation
    => inevitable: proletariate will seize the state and the means of productions + abolish
       private property (Revolution)
    = classless society

## Split in International Socialism, 1872
    * Debate over role of the state
        - Marxists wanted state power
        - ("dictatorship of the proletariat")
        - Anarchists wanted decentralised activism
    * Anarchists foresaw dangers of authoritarian socialism
        - Soviet Communism

## Karl Marx vs Mikhail Bakunin

# Marx
    * Marxists believed the state should seize control of the economy

# Bakunin
    * Anarchists believed in decentralised activism, not hierarchical; power corrupts, so 
      state should be abolished
