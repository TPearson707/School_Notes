## CoSc 472 - 5 minute presentation - How will AI Affect Cybersecurity


## Negatives of AI
   * phishing
     - Phishing becomes harder to detect because before it would be quite obvious it was fake
       because the it would typically not be the writers first language, and they were not
       very proficient in it
     - Now they can manipulate chatbot models to generate very natural sounding language. 
   * Malware
     - AI will get better at writing code as time goes on, and the llms are further trained.
       - This means it could potentially write malware, could insert malware into code that I
         have, it could also insert backdoors into the code that I have
       - Have to verify that the code it gives is pure 
   * Misinformation
     - Suffers from an issue called
       - Hallucination
         - May make up information, or conflate two things that aren't necessarily related
           and may give a false impression.
     - A threat could do a prompt injection and insert bad information into the system, or 
       they attack the corpus which is the body of knowledge that system is based on
   * Deepfakes
## Positives of AI

   * CODB
     - IBM does a Cost of a Data Breach survey every year
       - they found that the #1 thing to save on CODB & improve response time is the extensive
         use of AI and automation
         - can save on average $1.76M 
         - can cut down mean time to identify and contain breech by 108 days
   * Analysis 
     - by utilizing machine learning we can much more easily spot patters, outliers  
       and anomoly's

   * Automation
     - AI Can anticipate what we need to do next (Deep Learning)
   * Summarizing
     - Can be fed a ton of information, and AI can summarize it very well.
       - incident/case summ
       - What is the trend among these cases
   * Interact
     - Can respond to them with natural language rather than having to be very good at
       querying you can use naturaly language rather than a form of syntax
     - Example
       - Are we being affected by this particular malware in english
       - builds a query that I can run in my environment 
       - then can tell me if i'm infected or not
       - then I can ask tell me about this malware, what kind of indicators of compromise are 
         associated with
       - gives a very intuitive way to get info that is highly technical out of system much faster
